# RAM

* Shown vacuum tube and different kind of RAM
* shown video cards, sound cards, network cards

## Types
* Dynamic RAM - DRAM
  * For Main memory, capacitors lose their charge and have to be refreshed
  * Cheaper to produce and lots can be crammed in
* Static RAM - SRAM
  * No refreshing
  * In cache
  * Expensive

* Magneto-Resistive RAM - MRAM
  * Stored as magnetic charge
  * Non-volatile
  * **Not yet** found in PCs

### DRAM TYPES
* See table
* See slide of RAM speedws
* Table of Industry names

## Speed Measurement
* Sequential access vs random access

### Access time
* RAM measured in nano
* HDD measure in millioseconds

## Memory Modules
* Notch changed positions so RAM cna't go in the wrong slot

## Multi Channel
* Make journal note about RAM slots in practical exercise day
* Populate slots in pairs for dual channel

## Memory Errors
* Spaceships need to be shielded to deal with cosmic rays and such changing memory

### Detection/Correction
* Older ram had extra chip on it "parity" memory
* ECC (error correcting code) memory is more modern way of dealing with it
* ECC can detect and correct single-bit errors
* Used when data corruption cannot be tolerated

## "Universal" Memory
* Being researched to find cost of DRAM, speed of SRAM, Non-volatile and infinite durability

Looked at two PSUs

# Case and PSU
* Form factor
* Voltage regulator module (VRM) steps down power to appropriate voltage for components

## PSU


## Parellel vs Serial
* Parallel over long distances and higher speeds doesn't work well
* Can get beter transfer over serial at high speed
