# SEcond Agile Notes

Shy nerd- realsied not good for career
FOrced self to say hello to  receptionist
Biggest thing is change in lvel of ksills

Aspects of persoanlity far more changeable than thought
Positive Psycholgy
Had ups and downs in his interactions
Looked to agile for help
Individual and interactions more importan than processes and tools
Agile broken if focus is tools

OB slide 

Polkicial skill at work
Can earn influencing peopel - learnable skill
Nobdoy talks about laerning these ksills - but are learnable

The lack of focus on soft skills and the fact that they are skills - they can be learned

Went through epiphany, his eyes were opened and went round evangelising abohut how people connect in IT

Connecting with others is as important as technical skill

-----

We did a note taking exercise where we awatched a video and took notes on it in order
to allow us a self-critique of our note-taking skills and allow us to see areas where
we could use improvement.

The video was about the underrated importance of soft skills in IT and the fact these soft skills cna be developed.

Ray talked a bit aboout the way the presenter talked and the assessment where we will have to give our own presentation.
